# CryptoClustering

**Student name:** Tania Barrera

---

This repo contains my work for the challenge that corresponds to Module 19 of the UofT SCS edX Data Bootcamp.

## Deliverables

Notebook: [Crypto_Clustering.ipynb](Crypto_Clustering.ipynb)

## Instructions

1. Intial data description and visualization
2. Data scaling
3. Using Elbow Plot to find optiomal k value
4. Cluster Analysis with K-Means
5. PCA
6. Repeat 3 and 4 but with PCs


Question: What is the best value for k?

Answer: From the plot, I would guess 4, since that is the point where the slope stabilizes and starts dropping more steadily.

Question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

Answer: The total is 89.5%. Each principal component individually explains 37.2%, 34.7% and 17.6%.

Question: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?

Answer: It seems to be 4, since that is where the elbow curve starts having a smooth slope.

Question: Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

Answer: No, that is the same value I chose previously
